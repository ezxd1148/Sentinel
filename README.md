# Sentinel

High-performance, AI-driven security agent that anchors forensic logs to the Polkadot blockchain

> This project is built for Polkadot Solidity Hackathon 2026

Sentinel allows for enhanced security while still maintaining efficient gas usage using newest Solidity and Polkadot integrated with Nim compiled to C for heavy mathing.

Current security tools have a fatal flaw. If a hacker gains root access, they can delete logs to cover their tracks.
**Sentinel** solves this by implementing a Zero-Trust Forensic Architecture

It uses a high-speed Nim engine to capture and encrypt threat data in real-time, stores the encrypted evidence on decentrelized storage (IPFS) and anchors a "fingerprint" (Hash) to solidity smart contract. This creates an immutable and verifiable chain even admin cannot alter
